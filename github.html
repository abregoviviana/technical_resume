<h2>Key Concepts:<h2>
<p>A key concept that would have helped in my understanding of Github from the outset of the course would be the why behind storing code repositories only. The concept didn’t not really become apparent until later skills like Powershell and Linux when I tasked with pulling scripts from online Github repositories. </p>
<p>While attempting to login to lab.github.com, I received error messages on several occasions. I submitted several tickets to Github, which would fix it temporarily but never give me a root cause. The best work around I have found is to use incognito mode on your browser. </p>

<p>Sometimes you will complete an activity and the bot won't respond even if you have clearly completed the activity is it waiting for before it continues. Post a description with a screenshot on the community page under the Github lab issues thread and a moderator will respond with a solution.</p>

<p>While completing the Markdown section of the Github courses, I constantly referred to this <a href="https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/">Wiki.</a> </p>
<p>When it came time to create my technical resume using GitHub pages the following article was a great <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/">how to guide</a>. I chose to push my webpages in the gh-pages branch of my repository as suggested. However, as I started to upload more pages and content such as images and pdf documents, I had to be mindful of what branch the items were being committed to.  Many times, I would accidently commit something to the master branch rather than the branch I was working in.</P>  

<h2>Online Course Evaluation:<h2>
<p>Overall, the courses offered by lab.github.com provided a great working knowledge of Github. The interactive nature of the courses made sure that the content was not just delivered in the abstract. While there were sometimes problems with the bots not sending you to the next step in the course, the team at tech support at Github was extremely responsive to posts in the community lab forums. The only flaw in the delivery of this content was that I waited until the end of the semester before I began creating my Github page for my final project. After months of not using this tool, I needed to retake the courses to make sure I could complete the assignment. I would suggest tasking students with the creation of their Github project template page within the first few weeks of the semester.</p>
