<h2>Takeaways:</h2>
<p>GitHub provides a good environment for anyone wanting to create their own webpage, which can be as simple of as complex as they want it to be. Because you can use a variety of coding languages, from Markdown to Java, to php, or html, GitHub is a versatile tool for any programmer. </p>

<p>One of the best parts about GitHub is also its interactive lab courses, which take you through the entire web-page building process and gets you started building your stuff. As with many things, I did run into some issues while taking the course. The main issue being that sometimes the GitHub lab bot that guides you through the tasks would sometimes take a while to respond or not respond at all. The tasks are intuitive enough that you can go follow what the next task would be on your own. However, the tasks are not marked as completed, leaving you with a, technically, unfinished course. 

Whenever this issue, or any issue with any of the labs for that matter, pops up, I recommend submitting your issue to the GitHub community forum under the thread for the GitHub learning lab. The moderators are usually quick to respond and will try to fix the issue as soon as possible. </p>

<p>As part of this course, I also had to create a technical resume using GitHub pages. While completing it, I referenced this <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Wiki</a> a lot. I also learned a lot by going through this <a href="https://blog.webjeda.com/https://blog.webjeda.com/">blog</a> while I was creating my technical resume.</p>
<p>Also, from creating this technical resume, I also learned that GitHub, while easy to use, can get quite complicated very quickly if you are not careful. Part of this is because GitHub, as an open-sourced site, allows users to provide their own code for others to use. This is a really neat feature when you are looking for a theme to use on your GitHub page, for example. All you have to do is "fork" their repository and, violà, you get your own repository filled with all the items you need to use that theme. 

However, because it is someone else's code, it is not always as intuitive to figure out and can overwhelm you very quickly if you rush through it. Therefore, if you are planning to use any of the open source Jekyll themes, I would recommend giving yourself ample time to look through it. I would also recommend creating a gh-pages branch and making it your default branch. This way whenever you are making changes, you are making them to the gh-pages branch by default and won't accidentally mess up your master branch.</P>  

<h2>Online Course Evaluation:</h2>
<p>GitHub is a powerful tool that can help even the most novice of users start creating their own content. It helps introduce the concept of a change management process, which is something I would have liked to know more about before entering the corporate world. As a student, I rarely, if ever, kept track of the changes I made, even while working with volatile code. However, working as a network engineer for a corporation, I have had to learn how to plan ahead in terms of making changes to a production environment. This is because all changes must get approved by a change management board before they can be implemented. GitHub does a good job of introducing this concept by taking you through interactive labs and showing you exactly how it gets done. Therefore, I would definintely recommend GitHubs lab courses to anyone wanting to enter the IT industry in the future.</p>
