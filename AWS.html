	<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
  <p>This course spends a lot of time covering the advantages of moving to a cloud environment. They describe the AWS platform as a utility that is on-demand, quickly available and pay-as-you go. One of the major selling points for new customers is the elimination of the need for large up-front capital investments for traditional on-prem data centers. This shifts costs from up-front sunk costs to variable costs that can grow with business needs. </p>
	  
<p>Another large selling point that Amazon taps into with this AWS online coursework is the business need for availability and stability of the their data. Using their Region and Availability Zone system, AWS can provide the infrastructure redundancy that can meet business continuity needs. </p>
<p>This course also spends time discussing the shared responsibility model for cloud security. They break this down in very easy to understand terms: “While AWS manages security <strong>of</strong> the cloud, you are responsible for security <strong>in</strong> the cloud.” I believe this is an important concept for IT individuals to share with their customers when implementing the  AWS platform.
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-technical-content/latest/aws-overview/security-and-compliance.html">AWS Security and Compliance</a></p>

	<h2>Online Course Evaluation:</h2>
<p>Overall, this content provided me with the terminology and basic components of the AWS platform. However, since this is just a video series with quizzes, I do would not be able to begin set up of or migration to this platform. While I believe a fundamental knowledge of this type of technology is valuable for a young IT professional, spending more time understanding the servers and applications that would run on this type of platform is more beneficial. Therefore, I would recommend removing this course from the curriculum in favor of a deeper dive into other areas such as PowerShell and Active Directory setup.

	<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
  <p>If someone needed to become aware of the different services offered through AWS, the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials training would be perfect. AWS makes it easy to register by allowing you to use your existing Amazon.com account, if you have one. Once registered, AWS will take you through the different concepts applied in AWS and the different services it offers in greater detail. Near the end, the training even offers different pricing methods and recommendations for the different types of organizations. </p>
	  
<p>Another good thing about this training is that it provides a clear learning path for you to follow. Once you have completed a module, the module is grayed out. Or if you have finished with that module, whenever your return, AWS remembers where you left off and will ask if you would like to continue from were you left off. In this way, you are never confused as to where you are within the training.  </p>
<p>Moreover, if you did not quite understand a certain topic the people in the videos where talking about, apart from rewinding the video, AWS also provides a transcript   option on the left navigation panel that you can follow along with, if needed.</p>

	<h2>Course Notes:</h2>
<p>The AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials training is not ideal for any sort of technical training. Apart from the videos, the Cloud Practitioner training does not provide any sort of labs or exercises to help you create your own AWS environment. To get any sort of exposure to AWS instances and the services offered, you would have pay an obscene amount to use a simple trial version. Therefore, unless you are an organization looking into bring AWS into your network, obtaining an AWS environment is close to impossible for the average user. 

Because of its lack of hands-on training, the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials training is not the best training for anyone who is trying to learn how to use AWS. Moreover, most of what is found in the videos for this training can also be found within the AWS site. You do not need to watch several hours of videos if you were simply curious as to what AWS provides.
