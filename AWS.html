	<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
  <p>This course spends a lot of time covering the advantages of moving to a cloud environment. They describe the AWS platform as a utility that is on-demand, quickly available and pay-as-you go. One of the major selling points for new customers is the elimination of the need for large up-front capital investments for traditional on-prem data centers. This shifts costs from up-front sunk costs to variable costs that can grow with business needs. </p>
	  
<p>Another large selling point that Amazon taps into with this AWS online coursework is the business need for availability and stability of the their data. Using their Region and Availability Zone system, AWS can provide the infrastructure redundancy that can meet business continuity needs. </p>
<p>This course also spends time discussing the shared responsibility model for cloud security. They break this down in very easy to understand terms: “While AWS manages security <strong>of</strong> the cloud, you are responsible for security <strong>in</strong> the cloud.” I believe this is an important concept for IT individuals to share with their customers when implementing the  AWS platform.

	<h2>Online Course Evaluation:</h2>
<p>Overall, this content provided me with the terminology and basic components of the AWS platform. However, since this is just a video series with quizzes, I do would not be able to begin set up of or migration to this platform. While I believe a fundamental knowledge of this type of technology is valuable for a young IT professional, spending more time understanding the servers and applications that would run on this type of platform is more beneficial. Therefore, I would recommend removing this course from the curriculum in favor of a deeper dive into other areas such as PowerShell and Active Directory setup.
