<h2>Takeaways:</h2>
<p>To get the most out of the training, I recommend downloading your own Linux distribution and setting it up in a virtual machine. While the guru99 training does a good job at introducing you to Linux, the training does not have any labs associated with it that you can use to apply what you have learned. By installing your own Linux distribution, you can follow along with the training sessions and improve your overall understanding of Linux. It does not necessarily have to be Ubuntu, which is the distribution system the training recommends you install. </p>

<p>There are other beginner-friendly distributions, such as Linux Mint. However, going through the training is a lot easier when you know you are working with the same distribution as the training sessions. Moreover, if you are like me, and already have a Linux distribution system set up (Linux Mint), it also helps knowing you are starting from a blank state and won't have to deal with making sure everything you have is backed up in the case something messes up. </p>
<p>While going through the triaining, I did run into some issues, mostly while setting up Ubuntu. The training recommends allocating 8GB of memory for the virtual hard drive. However, this recommendation is for Ubuntu 14.04, which is actually a much older version of Ubuntu. The current version, 18.04.1 TLS, which is also the one you are taken to when you follow the link the training session provides, will not install if you only allocate 8 GB of memory. After experimenting a couple of times with the install, I found that Ubuntu works best if you allocate at least 10 GB of memory to its virtual hard drive. It requires a minimum of 8.6 GB, but even at 8.6 GB, it would not install. At 9 GB, Ubuntu installed just fine. However, when it came to using it, it was slow and took a while to start anything up. </p>
<h2>Course Notes:</h2>
<p>Guru99 is a good course for beginners. It walks you through what Linux is, the different types of distributions, and how to install them. It also provides a good working knowledge of the Linux CLI, which I have learned through working in IT for a corporation will make your life a whole lot easier if you are at least familiar with it. Of all the training courses I went through, I would recommend doing this one first because it gets you comfortable with working through a command line and makes it easier to go through the other training courses, such as PowerShell, which is almost all through the command line.  </p>
