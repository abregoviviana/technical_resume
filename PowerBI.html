 <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
<p>With PowerBI, you can bring in data from various sources and create visually appealing dashboards while making them as simple or as interacate as you would like. Moreover, because it is by Microsoft, the interface is simple to use because it is similar to its Office suite counterparts. </p>
<p>The downside to PowerBI is that it is only available for Windows PCs. As a Mac user, this presented an issue when I was trying to complete the labs. The PowerBI Service, which is the online version of PowerBI Desktop, was available for me to use. However, whenever I tried importing an Access database through the service, I found that PowerBI Service did not have this capability as it only lets you import a more limited set of data types. If you want the full set of importing options, you have to use PowerBI desktop. I ended up having to use my work laptop, which has a Windows OS, to complete the labs.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the training course can be quite finicky. Sometimes if you don't let the videos play all the way through, it will not mark the section as complete. In which case, you have to go back and let the video play all the way to the end and click through the other sections a couple of times before it is marked as complete. </p>

<h2>Course Notes:</h2>
<p>The training through edX provides a good, interactive introduction to PowerBI. Not only does it test your knowledge after every part, but it also provides labs for you to apply what you have just learned. Moreover, this is also a good training source for anyone wanting to learn more about data warehousing because it provides a visual, step-by-step process to cleaning and transforming data. It also introduces you to data modeling and data analytics. However, I will admit that going through the training is easier if you already have some familiarity in working with databases as it works similar to Microsoft Access in that it uses relationships to connect different data sources. </p>
